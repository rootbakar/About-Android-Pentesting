# This tutorial for apk install via "drag" issue - Android `7.0` API `24` [FIXED]

**If you get trouble when you want to install an apk by dragging it into your android genymotion**

  ```
  An error occured while deploying the file.
  This probably means that the app contains ARM native code and your Genymotion device cannot run ARM instructions. 
  You should either build your native code to x86 or install an ARM translation tool in your device.
